# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Breast Cancer Detection

## Project Overview
This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify **Breast Cancer** cases using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**. The implementation includes preprocessing steps like **Normalization** and **Standardization**, as well as a **hyperparameter tuning** process to find the optimal number of neighbors (`k`) using **cross-validation**.

## Features
- Loads the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** using `sklearn.datasets`.
- **Preprocessing** using both **Standardization** and **Normalization** techniques.
- **Train-test split** to evaluate model performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning to determine the best `k` value through **cross-validation**.
- **Model evaluation** using **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix**.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
To run the project, execute the script:

```bash
python knn_breast_cancer.py
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Loading the Dataset**
The **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** is loaded from `sklearn.datasets` and converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier analysis and manipulation.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Normalization**: Scaling the feature vectors using `Normalizer()`.
- **Standardization**: Transforming the features using `StandardScaler()` to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.

### 3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- The script evaluates **odd values of k** (from `1` to `49`) using **10-fold cross-validation**.
- The best `k` is chosen based on minimizing the **error (1 - accuracy score)**.

### 4. **Training and Testing the KNN Classifier**
- The KNN model is trained using the best `k` value with the **Manhattan distance metric**.
- Predictions are made on the test data.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
- **Accuracy**: The overall model performance is evaluated.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The matrix is visualized using Seaborn for deeper analysis of the modelâ€™s predictions.

## Example Output
```bash
Optimal number of neighbors: 5
Accuracy: 0.9649
```

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of over **95%**, demonstrating that KNN is a suitable method for breast cancer classification when paired with preprocessing and optimal hyperparameter selection.

## Potential Improvements
- Test different distance metrics such as Minkowski or Chebyshev.
- Optimize feature selection techniques.
- Compare KNN with other machine learning models like **SVM** or **Random Forest**.
